📂 Customized Virtual File System (CVFS)
🛠️ Technology

Language: C Programming

📌 Project Overview

This project is a custom implementation of a Virtual File System (VFS) that simulates the core functionality of the Linux file system.

It is built entirely in C, with its own custom shell to interact with the virtual environment.

The project provides hands-on understanding of:

System calls

File handling

Memory management

Operating system internals

🚀 Key Features
🖥️ Custom Shell Interface

Provides Linux-like commands for file operations:

create

open

read

write

delete

ls

man

exit

⚙️ System Call Simulation

Implements core Linux file system system calls using C:

open

read

write

lseek

close

rm

ls

🗂️ File System Data Structures

Internally simulates:

Incore Inode Table

File Table

UAREA (User Area)

User File Descriptor Table (UFDT)

Super Block

Boot Block

🌍 Platform Independent

Simulates Linux-style file handling logic

Can run on any operating system with a C compiler

🗃️ Database-like Functionality

Structured file handling

Organized metadata management

Controlled memory allocation

Simulated storage management

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Deep understanding of Linux File System internals

Practical knowledge of OS data structures (inode, file tables, UAREA)

Strong grasp of system programming in C

Hands-on experience with shell design and command interpreter

Application of low-level logic building for OS-like environments

▶️ Example Usage
$ ./Myexe
